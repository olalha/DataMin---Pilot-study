Notification of Unauthorised or Incorrect Payments If you believe that a payment on your account was not authorised by you or was made incorrectly you must notify us as soon as possible either at a branch or by telephoning us on the number shown at the end of these Terms and Conditions.
This number can also be found in the Key Facts Document your statement your card carrier and on our website.
Your Remedies for Unauthorised Payments Your remedy for an unauthorised payment will depend on whether or not your account was overdrawn at the time the unauthorised payment was taken or if it was in credit.
If your account was in credit at the time of the unauthorised payment but the payment took it into overdraft each element of the payment will be treated separately for these purposes a Subject to Condition 13.3 in Section 2A we will not refund you in any circumstances if
you authorised the payment
someone else used your card with your agreement
you have acted fraudulently. b Subject to Condition 13.3 in Section 2A except where your account is in overdraft we will also not refund you if
someone else used your passbook PIN or Personal Security Details with your agreement
you deliberately or with gross negligence disclosed your PIN or Personal Security Details to someone else
you deliberately failed to follow any of the safeguards referred to in Condition 9.7 in Section 2A or you are grossly negligent in failing to follow any of them
after becoming aware you delayed unreasonably in notifying us that the payment was unauthorised or
you failed to tell us the payment was unauthorised within 13 months of the date on which the payment occurred or ought to have occurred. c In all other cases if you notify us that a payment was not authorised by you we will refund to your account the amount of the payment and any fees and/or interest and charges directly incurred on the account as a result of the payment or which would not have been incurred or would have been earned on the account had the unauthorised payment not been made. d However where your card mobile device passbook PIN or your Personal Security Details are used without your authority by someone else in circumstances other than those in Condition 13.3 in Section 2A then we may debit up to £35 from you before applying the refund.
You will be responsible for the full amount of the payment if any of the circumstances in a or b of this Condition 7.2 apply. e We will refund your account
If your account is overdrawn as soon as we are reasonably satisfied that you are entitled to the refund or
If your account is in credit by the end of the next Working Day after we become aware of the unauthorised payment.
Before we refund your account we are entitled to carry out an investigation if there are reasonable grounds for us to suspect that you have acted fraudulently or we can show that you’ve acted deliberately or have been grossly negligent. f We may debit your account with any amount refunded under e where we subsequently become aware that the circumstances in a or b of this Condition 7.2 apply. g If you dispute that you have carried out a payment with a card passbook cheque PIN or Personal Security Details we expect you to co-operate with us and the police in any investigations.
We can give the police and other banks that are involved any information necessary to enable them to carry out their investigations.
We have to prove any allegation of fraud or that you were grossly negligent in failing to follow any of the safeguards listed in Condition 9.7 in Section 2A or that a card has been received by you.
We will conduct any investigation as quickly as possible and may ask you to reasonably assist in that investigation.
Your Remedies for Incorrect Payments We are responsible for making payments on your account correctly.
If you tell us that a payment has not been made or has been made incorrectly by us after you tell us we will a refund your account with sufficient money to restore your account to the same position as if the incorrect payment had not been made.
This normally means that we will refund your account with any fees and interest we have charged or you may have lost in connection with the incorrect payment b if you ask us to make immediate efforts to trace the incorrect payment and notify you of the results of that action.
If a payment has been delayed because of our error we can at your request ask the receiving bank to ensure that the payment is credited to the payee’s account as if it was made on time.
Payments made into your account in error If a payment is made into your account by mistake the money may be taken back out of your account.
How and when we do this will depend on the type of payment and the reason for the mistake. a For CHAPS payments and SEPA credit transfers if the sending bank or the sender has made a mistake we will not take the money back out of your account without your permission.
If you do not think that the payment has been made in error we will let the sending bank know. b For BACS payments or Faster Payments if we reasonably believe the sending bank or the sender has made a mistake and tells us
within 2 months of the money being paid into your account we may prevent you from using the money and we can take the money back out of your account and return it to the sending bank.
We do not need your permission to return the money
after 2 months of the money being paid into your account we will not take the money out of your account without your permission. c If we have incorrectly credited any payment to your account we will take the money back out of your account.
We do not need your permission to do so.
If a payment is made into your account by mistake you agree that we may share all relevant information with the sending bank so that the payer can trace the money.
We do not need to do any of the things listed in Condition 7.3 in Section 2A and we are not responsible for an incorrect payment on your account where a you fail to tell us using the contact details provided in this 13 PART 2 Section 2A document and in the Key Facts Document of the incorrect payment without undue delay and in any case within 13 months of the date on which the payment occurred or in the case of a failed payment ought to have occurred or b the cause of the incorrect payment is because you gave us the wrong or insufficient Payment Details for us to make the payment or c we can demonstrate to you and if applicable the beneficiary’s bank that the beneficiary’s bank received the payment within the relevant execution time listed either in Condition 6.4 in Section 2A or in Condition 1.1 in Section 2F in which case the beneficiary’s bank is legally required to make the payment to the person you want to pay.
In these circumstances we will use reasonable efforts to recover any money paid out of your account or not paid into your account as a result of the failed or incorrect payment.
Fees or interest you pay are listed in the Key Facts Document and if you have a current account certain fees and charges are also set out in the Fee Information Document.
We give you our current interest rates and fees information when you apply for your account.
These can be obtained by contacting us or checking our website.
Interest we pay you is calculated on a daily basis unless we have told you otherwise.
The Key Facts Document will explain when and the frequency with which we may pay you interest.
This will be at least annually but may be more frequent if your account allows.
For the purpose of calculating interest we work on the basis that there are 365 days in a year unless it is a leap year where interest is calculated on a 366 day basis.
Interest is calculated differently in a leap year and deposits made after 29 February will receive less interest than they would in a non-leap year.

Important information about compensation arrangements We are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme
The FSCS can pay compensation to depositors if a bank is unable to meet its financial obligations.
Most depositors including most individuals and businesses are covered by the scheme.
In respect of deposits an eligible depositor is entitled to claim up to the current FSCS limit.
For joint accounts each account holder is treated as having a claim in respect of their share so for a joint account held by two eligible depositors the maximum amount that could be claimed would be the current FSCS limit each.
The current FSCS limit relates to the combined amount in all the eligible depositor’s accounts with the bank including their share of any joint account and not to each separate account.
For further information about the compensation provided by the FSCS including the amounts covered and eligibility to claim please ask at your local branch refer to the FSCS website www.FSCS.org.uk or call the FSCS on 020 7741 4100 or 0800 678 1100.
Please note only compensation related queries should be directed to the FSCS.
Santander UK plc is an authorised deposit taker and accepts deposits under this name and the cahoot and Santander Corporate and Commercial Bank trading names.
If you do not make any transactions on your account for one year in the case of current accounts and three years in the case of savings accounts then we may treat your account as being dormant to remove the risk of fraudulent activity.
This means that we will stop sending you statements letters and cards.
To make your account active again you will have to go into one of our branches and show personal identification such as a passport or driving licence.
If you are unable to visit us in a branch please call us on 0800 587 3344 for further advice.
We participate in the unclaimed assets scheme established under the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act 2008.
The purpose of the scheme is to enable money in dormant accounts i.e. balances in accounts that have been inactive or dormant for 15 years or more to be distributed for the benefit of the community while protecting the rights of customers to reclaim their money.
Under the scheme we may transfer balances of dormant accounts to Reclaim Fund Limited RFL.
RFL is a not-for-profit reclaim fund which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
If we transfer the balance of your account to RFL you will have against RFL whatever right to payment of your balance you would have had against us if the transfer had never happened.
However we will remain responsible for managing all aspects of the customer relationship with you and for handling all repayment claims which we will do on behalf of RFL.
Therefore you should continue to contact us in the usual way if you have any queries or complaints in relation to your account or balance.
Both we and RFL participate in the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS.
The transfer by us to RFL of your balance will not adversely affect any entitlement you have to compensation from the FSCS.
You consent to us using your information to provide payment services to you.
If you withdraw this consent we will stop providing payment services but may still use your data where we have lawful grounds to do so for example because we need to retain records for regulatory purposes.
Tax applicable if you are covered by the tax requirements of another country
We may be legally obliged to disclose information about you and your Account to HMRC who may in turn pass this on to other tax authorities in line with international agreements or treaties that may be in force.

You agree to inform us promptly in writing if any of your personal information changes or there is any change in the circumstances following any certification that you may have provided to us.

Dependent on your particular account type this can include Arranged Overdraft Usage Fees Unarranged Overdraft Usage Fees fees for allowing or refusing a payment despite/due to lack of funds in your account.
Please refer to your product specific Key Facts Document and the Fee Information Document for the caps that apply to your current account. ¡ If you plan to use an overdraft regularly on your current account it will be cheaper to arrange an Arranged Overdraft rather than use our Unarranged Overdraft service.

We will ensure that your existing regular payment mandates directly linked to your old accounts e.g.
Standing Orders Direct Debits and bill payment mandates are set up on your New Account and details of your existing payment beneficiaries are transferred to your New Account.
In cases where we cannot match the payment frequency of your existing regular payment mandates we will contact you to agree alternative arrangements.
Note If you have arranged to make recurring payments using your Old Account debit card number your Old Bank won’t know your New Account debit card number so won’t be able to transfer these to your New Account.
This means that there is no guarantee that payment requests sent to your Old Account will be redirected to your New Account.
The supplier may contact you to request the details of your New Account debit card.
We recommend that you contact the supplier to set up a new recurring payment to ensure any service you receive e.g. insurance is not interrupted.
We will also transfer any future dated payments e.g. with a due date after your Switch Date that you set up on your Old Account more than 6 working days before your Switch Date to your New Account to ensure these are made on the date originally requested.
The regular payment mandates that we will set up on your New Account as part of the switch will be in operation from the day after the Switch Date.
If you have any existing regular payment mandates that are non-sterling or that quote a BIC or IBAN these won’t be switched to your New Account automatically.
If we can facilitate non-sterling mandates or ones that quote a BIC or IBAN you will have to provide us with the relevant details separately so that we can set them up on your New Account.
If you make any changes to your regular payment mandates on your Old Account or set up any new payment beneficiaries on your Old Account on or after the 6th Working Day before the Switch Date you must tell us otherwise these changes will not be implemented on your New Account.
Your Old Bank will forward any funds remaining in your Old Account to your New Account on the Switch Date.
There may be a short period when the balance is being transferred when it will not be possible to access the funds being transferred.
Funds will be retained by your Old Bank to cover any transactions made before the Switch Date on your Old Account which are still in the process of being cleared on the Switch Date.
On the day that your Old Bank no longer needs to retain funds to cover transactions that are being cleared it will transfer them to your New Account and they will be credited to your New Account no later than the next Working Day.
Funds will also be retained by your Old Bank to cover debit card transactions that have already been authorised but which have not yet been paid out of your Old Account.
If you have outstanding debt on your Old Account including any fees or charges after the Switch Date your Old Bank will tell you.
You are liable for any outstanding debt on your Old Account remaining after the Switch Date.

We do not charge for this service however the existing cash ISA Manager may apply an exit charge.
When we may close your cash JISA
We can give the Child or if applicable the Registered Contact three months’ written notice if we plan to stop managing the cash JISA because a We decide in good faith that it is no longer reasonably practical for us to keep to the ISA Regulations b We decide that managing the type of JISA which the Child holds has stopped being commercially worthwhile for us.
During the period of notice the Child or if applicable the Registered Contact can transfer the cash JISA to another ISA Manager under Condition 11 in Section 2E.

You can have your own account as well as a joint account.
Many people have a joint ‘bills account’ for household outgoings but still have their salary paid into their own account.
joint account means joint responsibility so each person can use the account without the other person knowing.
Therefore if other people cause a problem on the account you’re also responsible for it.
Santander UK plc along with other banks and building societies share information about you and how you use credit products such as current accounts credit cards loans and mortgages via credit reference agencies.
If there are problems on a shared account you can find out more information about sharing information with credit reference agencies by reading our ‘Your application and credit scoring’ leaflet.
Everyone can receive a statement at different addresses for any account.
Just let us know that’s what you want.
Santander current account You’ll both get your own Santander debit card or cash card depending on the account you have as well as a chequebook if required so you can pay for things and withdraw money independently.
You can both pay money into the account or just one of you can it’s up to you.
Either of you can find out what’s going on with the account.
You both get access to our branches cash machines Telephone Banking and Online Banking.
If both of you are paying money into the account then you could have a higher balance to earn interest on or a bigger Arranged Overdraft facility.
If you borrow money using an Arranged or Unarranged Overdraft each of you is responsible for the whole debt no matter who borrowed it.
Please bear in mind that either of you can make withdrawals write cheques set up Arranged Overdrafts or use the cash machine without the knowledge of the other person.
To find out if a joint account is available to you please see your specific Account Key Facts Document.
Santander savings account Two or more people can share a Santander savings account with the exception of ISAs.
We’ll let you know how many people can share the account when you open it.
If your savings account has a cash card or you can use the phone or the internet to run the account all account holders can take money out of the account without telling each other.
With any other savings account you can choose whether all account holders have to sign to take money out or whether just one signature is enough.
If you wish to remove someone from the account everyone must agree to this.
Statements will be sent to the first named customer using the address recorded for that customer.
Everyone can receive a statement at different addresses for any account.
Just let us know that’s what you want.
Making changes If you want to remove an account holder’s name from the account we must have agreement from both account holders before we can do this.
If you decide to change the way you run your account you should consider the following ¡ All account holders are responsible for any money owed on the account. ¡ You can ask for the Arranged Overdraft to be removed from a current account provided you pay off any money owed.
The amount owed may increase should any transactions be presented for payment. ¡ If one of you becomes bankrupt we have to stop the account being used and the money may not be available for account holders to use. ¡ Santander UK plc has the right to move money from Santander accounts in any account holders’ name to cover any money owed on the joint account.
If you decide that a joint account isn’t working for you please let us know and we’ll help you find an alternative solution with us.

Therefore it is advisable to only leave money in the account if you are comfortable about leaving it to the other account holder.
If you have an Arranged Overdraft on your joint account or if your account goes into an Unarranged Overdraft you should be aware that the other account holder will be responsible for any money owed on the account.

trustee is an individual who either solely or with another trustee or trustees manages and invests assets for the benefit of another a beneficiary.
The trustee is obliged to make all trust-related decisions with the beneficiary’s interests in mind.
trustee may open an account in the name of a beneficiary to hold funds that are intended for future use such as education fees or the purchase of a house.
The trustee is the legal owner of the funds held in the account and is therefore the person we deal with regarding all aspects of servicing the account.
trustee can open an account on behalf of a child as long as the trustee is aged 18 or over.
beneficiary is an individual who the funds held in the account may eventually belong to.
The beneficiary of an account in trust is often but not always a child.
The beneficiary is unable to access the funds unless the trustees gives the funds to the beneficiary in any of the ways referred to in the paragraph below ‘How can a trustee release funds to a beneficiary’ What is a Trust Account
Trust Account is the term used for any Santander UK savings or bank account where a third party is registered as a trustee on the account.
The account is opened in the name of the beneficiary of the funds but fully managed by the trustees registered.
The account holder does not have any access to funds held in a trust account where they are the beneficiary.
What accounts can have a trustee registered
Most Santander UK savings accounts allow a trustee to be registered on the account.
The 1I2I3 Mini Account in Trust is available to Santander current account customers who open the account in trust see note 1.
When should a trustee release funds to a beneficiary
There is no set time when the trustee must release funds to the beneficiary.
The trustee can choose to hold the funds in trust indefinitely irrespective of the age of the beneficiary see note 1.
How can a trustee release funds to a beneficiary
An account held in trust cannot be accessed by the beneficiary therefore a trustee cannot give the beneficiary permission to access funds whilst the account continues to have a registered trustee.
In order to give the beneficiary access to the funds in the trust account either i the trustee must transfer the funds to an account held in the beneficiary’s name or ii the trustee must request that the account be transferred into the sole name of the beneficiary by removing the trustee from the account or iii the trustee must close the account via the usual account closure process see note 1.
Gross Interest Interest payments will be paid using the gross rate.
This means all the interest we pay will be without tax deducted.
If the total amount of interest received exceeds any Personal Savings Allowance tax may have to be paid at the applicable rate.
This would need to be paid directly to HM Revenue & Customs ‘HMRC’.
For more information please visit gov.uk and search for ‘Personal Savings Allowance’. £100 rule If the child receives more than £100 in interest per tax year from money given to them by a parent that interest would normally be taxed as the parent’s income.
The limit of £100 only applies to each given parent and does not apply to grandparents relatives or friends.
Additional questions should be referred to HMRC.
Death of a trustee Sole trustee The Customer Representative for a deceased trustee can appoint a new trustee or elect to release the funds in the account to the beneficiary the account holder.
This may vary by product.
For specific details on your account please refer to the Key Facts Document provided when you open your account.
Joint trustee The deceased trustee should be removed from the account where the trust is in place.
If there is more than one trustee remaining on the account no further action is required.

An account with more than one trustee can be set up with the trustees choosing
‘Either/Any’ the account can then be operated by any of the registered trustees.
‘Combined’ access means that all trustees must authorise a transaction or account action before it can be made.
Depending on which access you choose this may affect the channels available to service your account.
Please speak to us for more information.

Any cash in your ISA and/or Investment Account can be used to purchase Investments.

The client money account in which cash in your ISA is held is designated as an ISA account under the Regulations.
Money paid into cash in your ISA counts towards your annual ISA limit.
All cleared single lump sum payments will initially be allocated as cash in your ISA and/ or Investment Account.
We may also allocate additional amounts as cash in your ISA and/or Investment Account for example by way of distribution payments or interest payments income or if investments are sold without making further purchases.
The balance of your Cash Only Account and cash in your ISA and/or Investment Account will be shown on your statements. 5 Interest

This rate of interest may fluctuate.
The applicable interest rates or method of calculation and any threshold amounts are explained in the Santander Investment Hub Key Features Document.
The applicable rate of interest may be more or less than we receive or may be zero.
Any interest due will be calculated daily based on the closing balance of the cash allocated to those accounts.
Any interest due will be credited during the calendar month.
In the event that you close your ISA or Investment Account mid-month interest accrued will be credited pro-rata.
We may make changes to the rates of interest including any method of interest rate calculation and/or any threshold amounts we use to decide which method of interest rate calculation or interest rate is applicable to you.
We may do this without giving you any prior notice provided that there’s a valid reason for making such a change and the change is proportionate and reasonable under the circumstances for example a if the rate of interest we receive from the banks we hold your money with changes b following or in anticipation of and to respond to a change in any relevant law or to meet any regulatory requirement or to reflect new industry guidance or applicable code of practice c to reflect other legitimate cost increases or reductions associated with our provision of the Hub and services to you or to respond to the costs or consequences of any event beyond our control that may impact our provision of Hub Accounts or services to you or d if the change is favourable to you. 6 Income and growth
Some Account Investments may generate income and Fixed Term Investments can generate cash through the realisation of any growth at maturity.
When you open an ISA and/or Investment Account you must choose whether to have this paid as cash and allocated to ¡ cash in your ISA and/or Investment Account ¡ a nominated bank account or ¡ be automatically reinvested to buy more Account Investments in the same Fund this option does not apply to Fixed Term Investments.
The choice you make will apply to all the Account Investments you hold in either the ISA or the Investment Account.
You can subsequently instruct us to move the cash in your ISA and/or Investment Account into a nominated bank account.
When moved from your ISA this will count as a withdrawal from an ISA and this cash may lose it’s tax-efficient status.
If you’d like to change where your income is paid you can contact us by phone or in writing by using the details in paragraph 24.
Other than for Special Access Accounts you can also do this online on the Hub.
We’ll normally make the change within 5 Working days.
It may take between 5 to 15 Working days after the Fund pays the income to us before the income is either paid to you or reinvested or paid to your nominated account.
If you choose to have income automatically reinvested to buy more Account Investments in the same Fund and the value of the income is not enough to buy the smallest fraction of a share or unit available we will allocate the income to cash in your ISA and/or Investment Account.
Where you’ve invested in an income paying Fund the Fund Provider may choose to retain the income and pay you in shares/units instead.
In this scenario we reserve the right to allocate the shares/units to your holdings in that Fund.
Information applicable to individual Funds is included in the relevant Fund Prospectus.
These documents can be found on the fund managers’ website.
Where we receive a pooled income payment in respect of Account Investments held by you and others we will allocate this in what we consider is a fair and equitable manner.
This may mean that the amount allocated to you is rounded up or down to the nearest penny.
This might result in a residual amount that cannot be fairly allocated between customers.
In such circumstances we may retain this residual amount. 7 Tax Applicable if you’re covered by the tax requirements of another country

You can’t instruct regular withdrawals from any Fixed Term Investments you hold.
Where your instruction is for a specific cash value when selling part of your holding rather than the proceeds of a number of shares or units we may not be able to accept the instruction if it is to cash in 85% or more of the Fund’s value.
For Fixed Term Investments only whole numbers of Notes and/or Securities can be cashed in.
This means if you ask us for a specific cash value you may not get the exact amount you’ve requested.
In addition we may not be able to accept the instruction if it is not in accordance with the minimum withdrawal amounts and/or minimum balance requirements set out in the relevant Product Guide.
We’ll normally process your instruction within 5 Working days of receipt of correct instructions however you may request a date after this period if you like.
Under the Regulations we can take up to 30 days to process your instruction in relation to your ISA.
You can choose to have the proceeds allocated to either your Cash Only Account cash in your ISA and/or Investment Account or a nominated bank account of your choice.
Any such proceeds from an Investment Account allocated to cash in your ISA will count towards the annual ISA subscription limit.
If you withdraw or cash in only some of the Account Investments you must keep to any minimum or limits and restrictions we tell you about in the Santander Investment Hub Key Features Document or relevant Product Guide.
The amount you get may be affected by any money we keep under paragraph 18.
Flexible features don’t apply to withdrawals from the ISA.
This means you can’t replace any money withdrawn in the same tax year without it counting towards your annual ISA limits.
If you’ve invested in a Fixed Term Investment we’ll contact you before the maturity date of your plan.
At maturity your invested amount held at maturity will be paid into cash in your ISA and/or Investment Account where it will remain until we receive further instructions from you.
Any growth or income received from your Fixed Term Investment will be paid in accordance with your instructions as set out in paragraph 6.1.
If you close your Investment Account and/or ISA any Platform Service Fee owing will be deducted from the proceeds. 6
You may close individual accounts within your Hub Account such as an ISA or an Investment Account.
You can also close your Hub Account which will mean that all accounts within it are also closed.
If you want to close an account you must instruct us to do this by phone or by writing to us.
We may close your Hub Account or a particular account in your Hub Account as explained in paragraph 16.
If and when your account is closed we will take all reasonable steps to pay you residual balances that subsequently arise.
If we’ve been unable to pay you you agree that we’ll donate amounts of £5 or less to a registered charity of our choice.
We’ll continue to hold any residual balances that are greater than £5 for you as client money.
Any money removed from your ISA will lose its tax-efficient status. 9 Joint Hub Accounts
You’re responsible individually and together for observing these Terms and Conditions including paying charges and any other money rightfully due to us.
If one of you dies the Account Investments belongs to the remaining holder.
Where an Investment Account is held jointly but with different security details to access the Hub a the Investment Account will be accessible by both holders b if one of you dies we will on receipt of satisfactory evidence of the death treat the survivor as being entitled to operate the Investment Account and c if one of you tells us that there is a dispute between the two of you we may freeze the Investment Account until we receive written instructions from both of you.
Where the Investment Account is to be held jointly by two individuals we’ll normally accept instructions from either one of you but we can’t be required by you to accept instructions from both of you only.
However there may be circumstances where we’ll insist on receiving instructions from both of you.
Where an Investment Account is jointly held any correspondence will be provided to both holders named on the Application.
An ISA can’t be held jointly.
There can only be two holders of a joint Investment Account.
Where you receive advisory services and you have a joint account Santander UK plc who provides the advisory services only needs permission from one account holder to view your joint account on the Hub. 10 Recognising others to exercise your rights
Our relationship is with you and we won’t recognise the interest or claim of any other person unless by law we have to for example where arrangements have been established under a trust.
This means for example that you can’t use any of the Account Investments as security for any borrowing or other money that you owe.
If you become incapable of managing your affairs we may allow a person appointed by the Court to manage your affairs to operate your Hub and the Hub Accounts within it. 11 Using others to carry out our duties
We may use an Associate company or other companies not connected with Santander UK plc to provide services relating to the Hub and accounts within it and pass all necessary information to them.
If we appoint others a we’ll keep responsibility for the way these duties are carried out and b we’ll make sure we’re satisfied that the Associate company or other company is able to carry out the duties.
We may appoint in our place an Associate company as Provider of your ISA.
The Associate company must be approved under the relevant Regulations as a Provider.
We must give you notice in writing beforehand so that you have the chance to transfer your ISA to a different Provider if you prefer. 12 Client money
We’ll hold all Cash as client money before we invest it or return or pay it to you in accordance with your instructions.
This includes a any payments you make to us b any money allocated to the Cash Only Account or cash in your ISA and/or Investment Account c any money due to you such as income and d the proceeds of selling any Account Investments on your behalf.
We’ll treat the money above in accordance with CASS.
Client money will be held in one or more accounts that we hold with Santander UK plc or other approved banks that may or may not be interest bearing.
These client money accounts may also include money we’ve been given by other customers because we also hold their money.
This means that your money is held as part of a common pool of money so you don’t have a claim against a specific account your claim is against the client money pool in general.
The client money accounts will however not hold our own money which means that these pooled client money accounts are kept separate from our own money held with such a bank.
If you’ve given us an investment instruction your money remains in the client money account until the deal settles and the money is transferred directly from the client money account in order to pay the settlement amount.
If you’ve given us a sell instruction the proceeds of the sale will be transferred directly to the client money account when the deal settles.
For all payments out your money will remain in a client money account until you’ve received and cashed any proceeds due to you.
We’ll use reasonable skill care and diligence in selecting appointing and monitoring an approved bank with whom we deposit your money but we are not liable for that bank’s acts or omissions.
In the event that the approved bank becomes insolvent your money would be pooled with the money of our other clients held with the approved bank and any shortfall would be borne by all of the clients in that pool proportionately.
If you have a shortfall you may be eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
If we were to become insolvent and there’s a shortfall in the client money account any losses will be shared proportionately across all our customers with money in that account in accordance with CASS.
In accordance with CASS we may cease to treat your money as client money when those balances remain unclaimed where a fees are due and payable to us or a third party.
We can use client money to pay those fees please see paragraph 18. b there’s been no movement on your balance in the client money account for six years any payments of charges or receipts of income or similar items will be disregarded and
where your balance is more than £25 we have taken reasonable steps to trace you and return the money to you
where your balance is £25 or less we have made at least one attempt to return your money using the most up-to-date contact details we hold for you and not received a response from you within 28 days.
Unclaimed funds will then be paid to a charity of our choice.
However this won’t affect your rights to this money at any time in the future.
In such circumstances we or an Associate company will unconditionally undertake to pay you a sum equal to the relevant client money balance paid away in the event that you seek to claim that balance in the future. 13 Transfer of business
Except in respect of FCA de minimis sums transferred in accordance with CASS where your consent isn’t required you agree that as part of a transfer of all or part of our business to a third party we may transfer without your specific consent any sums held as client money that relate to the business being transferred a provided that such third party will continue to hold your investment in accordance with CASS or b where this is not the case we’ll exercise all due skill care and diligence in assessing whether the third party will apply adequate measures to protect your investment.
We’ll give you 30 days’ prior notice of any transfer unless it’s impracticable to do so in the circumstances and in any case we’ll notify you no later than 7 days after the transfer takes place.
For the purposes of this paragraph the FCA de minimis sum shall mean £25 or less. 14 Adjustments where you hold Fixed Term Investments

If you wish to buy Account Investments you need to ensure that we receive your instructions before the dealing cut-off point for that Account Investment as stated in the Santander Investment Hub Key Features Document or the relevant Fixed Term Investment Product Guide and ensure that we are holding sufficient cleared funds from you.
If you hold a Special Access Account you cannot give us instructions to buy Account Investments that you do not already hold.
It can take 10 Working days to set up a new Direct Debit instruction.

Proceeds from cheque payments will not be available until we have received confirmation that the cheque has cleared.
During the clearance periods stated in paragraph 3.2 you won’t be able to withdraw this money.
No interest will be accrued on any uncleared funds.
Where you give us an instruction after the dealing cut-off point or before the dealing cut-off point but sufficient funds have not cleared in either case we will not execute your instruction on that day and will not be liable to you for failing to do so.
If the Account Investments are in Funds and we receive your cleared funds before the dealing cut-off point we’ll normally buy shares or units at the price worked out at the next valuation.
If we receive your instruction to sell before the dealing cut-off point we’ll normally sell shares or units at the price worked out at the next valuation.

We will not use any interest paid on this money to buy more Notes and/or Securities.
You’ll find details of the arrangements for buying and selling Fixed Term Investments in the relevant Product Guide. 11 Investment Hub Terms and Conditions

Where we receive a pooled amount of money in respect of Account Investments held by you and others we will allocate this in what we consider is a fair and equitable manner.
This pooled amount can arise as a result of selling Account Investments including following a corporate action.
This may mean that the amount allocated to you is rounded up or down to the nearest penny.
This might result in a residual amount that cannot be fairly allocated between customers.
In such circumstances we may retain this residual amount.
Where we are required to allocate a pooled number of shares/units between the customers that hold those Account Investments we will do in what we consider is a fair and equitable manner.
This pooled number of shares/units can arise as a result of buying Account Investments including following a corporate action.

Model Portfolio An allocation of reference investments and cash decided on and constructed at a model level by the Model Portfolio Manager in order to achieve an investment strategy to reflect a certain risk profile time horizon and cost parameters as set out in the Model Portfolio Management Agreement agreed between Santander UK plc and the Model Portfolio Manager and reflected in the Model Portfolio Factsheets.
For example a Model Portfolio may be created that is suitable for a target market with a medium attitude to risk and will therefore reference investments and potentially cash in relevant proportions that suit a medium attitude to risk.
Model Portfolio Management Agreement The agreement between Santander UK plc and the Model Portfolio Manager to provide discretionary model portfolio management services on the Model Portfolios in compliance with all applicable law and regulations.
The Model Portfolio Manager is responsible for the construction of the Model Portfolios and determination of the Rebalancing Rules in accordance with the investment strategies as set out in the Model Portfolio Management Agreement agreed between Santander UK plc and the Model Portfolio Manager.

Rebalancing This is the process by which Your Portfolio is adjusted back to reference the asset allocation of the relevant Model Portfolio because Your Portfolio has become misaligned from it to the extent that the Rebalancing Rules are triggered.
There are two possible causes of this misalignment firstly if the Model Portfolio Manager has used their discretion to change the reference assets and/or allocation in the Model Portfolio that Your Portfolio references secondly if the value of Your Portfolio Assets drift from the composition of the reference allocation of the relevant Model Portfolio because price fluctuations in the value of Your Portfolio Assets alter the proportion that each of Your Portfolio Assets represent within Your Portfolio.
This process may also occur for Your Portfolio if the Model Portfolio Manager determines in its discretion that a manual Rebalancing should occur.
All Rebalancing activity involves the purchase and/or sale of Your Portfolio Assets which can have tax implications as explained in paragraph 13.4.
Rebalancing Rules These are the rules that determine when Your Portfolio needs to be automatically Rebalanced if it has become misaligned from the relevant referenced Model Portfolio.
The Rebalancing Rules set out the extent to which the composition of Your Portfolio is permitted to misalign from the composition of the relevant Model Portfolio before it needs to be Rebalanced.
For example these rules might say that where a particular investment held in Your Portfolio is outside a set percentage of its proportion in comparison to the relevant Model Portfolio Your Portfolio is rebalanced back to reference this Model Portfolio.
When Rebalancing occurs Your Portfolio as a whole will reference the relevant Model Portfolio not only the part that was misaligned.
These rules are determined by the Model Portfolio Manager in accordance with the terms of the Model Portfolio Management Agreement between Santander UK plc and the Model Portfolio Manager and can be amended from time to time.
Santander UK plc may provide input and/or be consulted on these rules.
SIM monitors Your Portfolio for compliance with the Rebalancing Rules. 14 Santander UK plc Santander UK plc who provides the Financial Planning Services to you.

You may have more than one of these if you have portfolios in more than one account or if you have portfolios that reference different Model Portfolios.
The mix of Your Portfolio Assets and Portfolio Cash held in Your Portfolio can differ from the Model Portfolio over time because of price fluctuations in the value of Your Portfolio Assets which will alter the proportion that each of Your Portfolio Assets represents within Your Portfolio.
Your Portfolio may be Rebalanced.
Please see the definitions of Rebalancing and Rebalancing Rules for more information.
Your Portfolio Assets These are the assets that can be held within Your Portfolio including Investments as defined in the General Terms excluding Fixed Term Investments as well as Exchange Traded Funds and Instruments Structured Products and other tradable investments.

The Model Portfolio Manager is appointed by Santander UK plc acting as your agent to manage the Model Portfolios on a discretionary basis.
This means that the Model Portfolio Manager has the discretion to choose the mix of reference investments and cash and percentage allocation of assets for a Model Portfolio provided they are within the investment objective strategies and restrictions jointly set by Santander UK plc and the Model Portfolio Manager in the Model Portfolio Management Agreement.
Although Your Portfolio on the Hub will show Your Portfolio Assets and Portfolio Cash held in Your Portfolio the Model Portfolio Manager does not manage this specific collection of investments/cash for you and has no access to or visibility of Your Portfolio.
Santander UK plc acting as your agent
It is important to note that you are not the client of the Model Portfolio Manager and you do not have any direct contractual relationship with them.
In accordance with FCA rules the Model Portfolio Manager treats Santander UK plc acting as your agent as its client not you.
What this means in practice is that the Model Portfolio Manager does not owe any regulatory duties to you directly but to Santander UK plc. 15 Investment Hub Terms and Conditions Notwithstanding that the Model Portfolio Manager treats Santander UK plc as its client differently from how it would treat you as a retail client the Model Portfolio Manager has agreed with Santander UK plc that it will ensure that each of the Model Portfolios are suitable for retail clients.
The Model Portfolio Manager will only provide any required regulatory reporting or notifications to Santander UK plc as its client.
Notwithstanding this in order to ensure that you receive relevant information in relation to the Service SIM will take responsibility for ensuring that you receive the reports and notifications that you would otherwise receive if Santander UK plc was not acting as your agent.
Please note that contract notes will not be sent to you for any instructions that SIM execute in relation to Your Portfolios.
The Model Portfolio Manager has sole responsibility for setting the Rebalancing Rules in accordance with the terms of the Model Portfolio Management Agreement between Santander UK plc and the Model Portfolio Manager.

We will act on instructions from your Adviser acting as your agent on which Model Portfolios Your Portfolios will reference and whether Your Portfolios will be shown in your Investment Account or your ISA or both.
You are the beneficial owner of Your Portfolio Assets as shown in Your Portfolio.
Your Portfolio Assets are registered in the name of the Nominee as set out in the General Terms.
Please note that we hold Portfolio Cash as client money.
Please see the General Terms for terms on client money.
Unless you already have other accounts on the Hub simultaneous with creating Your Portfolio we will also open a Cash Only Account.
See the General Terms for terms relating to the Cash Only Account.
You can hold Your Portfolio on a joint basis with one other individual provided that the Investment Account which shows Your Portfolio is also held on a joint basis.
Your Portfolio cannot be held on a joint basis where you wish to hold it in an ISA.
See paragraph 9 of the General Terms for more information. 6 Your Portfolio Assets and Portfolio Cash
The range and mix of Your Portfolio Assets and/or Portfolio Cash in Your Portfolio will depend on the Model Portfolio that it references.
There are risks associated with investing and these largely depend on Your Portfolio Assets.
For more detailed information please refer to the Factsheets for the Model Portfolios.
If there is anything that you do not understand or agree with you should discuss this with your Adviser before investing.
The range of assets investments and securities that could be used to create a Model Portfolio are determined by the decisions of the Model Portfolio Manager in accordance with the investment strategies agreed with Santander UK plc in the Model Portfolio Management Agreement and the criteria we pre-set so that they can be held on the Hub.
This means that you cannot request that Your Portfolio includes a particular asset investment or security.
The fact that we show Your Portfolio Assets in Your Portfolio does not imply that we consider them to be suitable for your needs.
It is your Adviser’s responsibility to ensure that Your Portfolio is suitable for you.
You cannot transfer in assets held in a different/third party account even if those assets are the same as those referenced in the Model Portfolio. 7 Making payments in
When we are instructed by your Adviser to create Your Portfolio by reference to a Model Portfolio or where you are investing more money into Your Portfolio you must ensure there is sufficient cleared cash in your Cash Only Account.
We are not liable for any loss you may suffer due to a delay in processing instructions where there is insufficient cleared cash in your Cash Only Account.
Once cleared cash is available we will act on the Adviser’s instructions.
See the General Terms for further information on how to make payments in.
You can invest more money into Your Portfolios at any time subject to the annual ISA subscription limit if you are paying into Your Portfolio held within an ISA.
You can do this via your Adviser who will discuss the options with you.
You may be charged an Advisory Service Fee which is separate from your Ongoing Adviser Services Fee where you receive advice from your Adviser for a further investment into Your Portfolios.
If you invest more money into Your Portfolio we will purchase additional investments for Your Portfolio so as to align Your Portfolio closer with the relevant Model Portfolio that it references.
You cannot request that we purchase a specific investment for Your Portfolios. 8 Taking money out
You can take money out of Your Portfolios at any time by going through your Adviser who can discuss the options with you.
You can subject to paragraph 8.2 below take out a specific cash value a percentage of Your Portfolio’s value or by setting up a regular withdrawal.
You will need to discuss the impact of this with your Adviser first.
Although you can take money out to still be eligible for this Service you must keep the total combined value of Your Portfolios at or above the minimum operating balance at all times as set out in the Key Features Document.
In addition where you are taking a partial withdrawal you cannot take money out where this would result in more than 85% of Your Portfolio’s value being taken.
This restriction is there to prevent you from selling more of Your Portfolio Assets than are available in Your Portfolio if the price of Your Portfolio Assets drops between the time you give us an instruction and the time the instruction is processed.
Where your Adviser acting as your agent instructs us to take money out of Your Portfolio we will sell Your Portfolio Assets or take out Portfolio Cash so as to align Your Portfolios closer with the relevant Model Portfolio that it references.
You cannot request that we sell a specific investment from Your Portfolios.
The amount you get may be affected by any money we keep under paragraph 11 of this Schedule.
We will normally process instructions within 5 Working days of receiving correct instructions but your Adviser acting as your agent can ask us to process the instruction at a later date if you like.
Where Your Portfolio is shown in your ISA under the Regulations we can take up to 30 days to process your instruction.
Any money removed from your ISA will lose its tax-efficient status.
If you choose to repay the withdrawal into your ISA it will count towards your current tax year ISA allowance. 16
You can choose for the proceeds to remain in the ISA and/or Investment Account in which they sit or you can allocate them to your Cash Only Account in the Hub or have them paid out of the Hub to a nominated bank account of your choice.
Flexible features don’t apply to withdrawals from the ISA.
This means you can’t replace any money withdrawn from your ISA in the same tax year without it counting towards your annual ISA limits. 9 Your Adviser and instructions to us
Your Adviser acts as your agent for this Service and Your Portfolios and acts as the main point of contact between you and us in relation to this Service and Your Portfolio.

If you agree with this advice your Adviser will instruct us to make the change.
You cannot give us instructions to do this without advice from your Adviser.
If you don’t agree with this change this may mean that the Model Portfolios that Your Portfolios reference are no longer suitable for you see paragraph 18 for the consequences of this.
As the broker for the Model Portfolio Manager we monitor Your Portfolio to determine whether the Rebalancing Rules are triggered for Your Portfolio or whether we have received instructions from the Model Portfolio Manager that a manual Rebalance of Your Portfolios should occur.
If we receive instructions from your Adviser acting as your agent to change the Model Portfolios that Your Portfolios reference to a different Model Portfolio or if there is a Rebalancing triggered for Your Portfolio we will create and execute orders to buy and/or sell investments to ensure that Your Portfolio continues to be aligned with the relevant Model Portfolio that Your Portfolio references.
Where we create and execute orders to sell some of Your Portfolio Assets in order to buy others in order for Your Portfolio to continue to be aligned with the relevant Model Portfolio that it references we will use the proceeds from the selling transaction to buy other assets for Your Portfolio.
This process can have the following consequences 17 Investment Hub Terms and Conditions a you may incur a tax liability on the sale of the investments b your investment value may be lower following any transfer as a result of the difference in the price that we receive for selling your investments and the price we have to pay to buy the required investments this is known as the bid-offer spread c the money involved in these transactions won’t be invested in assets on the financial market for as long as this process takes.
This means that the market may have moved by the time we use the cash proceeds to buy the investments required.

Part B Transitional Terms for Premium Investments customers in the Model Portfolio Service Terms that apply If Your Portfolios only reference Premium Investments Model Portfolios the terms that apply to you are ¡ General Terms ¡ Schedules 1 to 3 ¡ Part A of this Schedule 4 this is because you are receiving the Model Portfolio Service in relation to your Premium Investments but amended as set out in this Part B and ¡ this Part B.
The above apply to you from the point that any of Your Portfolios that reference Premium Investments Model Portfolios are moved onto the Hub and until the earlier of 1 when you choose to keep your investments but not within the Model Portfolio Service 2 when you choose to sell your Premium Investments or 3 when we notify you that these terms no longer apply e.g. because the transitional period has ended.
If any of Your Portfolios reference other Model Portfolios that are not Premium Investments Model Portfolios then Schedule 4 Part A and not this Part B applies to you.
This is explained further in the table below Model Portfolios that Your Portfolios reference Applicable Terms Premium Investments Model Portfolios only and no other Model Portfolios ¡ Schedule 4 Part B and ¡ Schedule 4 Part A unless overridden by Part B Plus ¡ General Terms ¡ Schedule 1 ¡ Schedule 2 ¡ Schedule 3 Premium Investments Model Portfolios and other Model Portfolios Schedule 4 Part A Model Portfolios other than Premium Investments Model Portfolios Schedule 4 Part A 19 Investment Hub Terms and Conditions In addition you will need to review and agree to be bound by the separate terms that apply to the Financial Planning Services that you can obtain from your Adviser.
Note The Model Portfolio Service is not available to you if you do not agree to receive the Financial Planning Services from Santander UK plc.
The reason for this is that your Adviser needs to assess whether the Service is suitable for you and whether Your Portfolios continue to be suitable for you on an ongoing basis.
Clarification of Definitions All relevant terms in this Part B are defined in Schedule 4 Part A however some definitions need to be read in a different way when they are used in this Part B. ¡ Model Portfolio is defined in Part A.
When used in this Part B it only relates to Model Portfolios that are Premium Investments Model Portfolios. ¡ Your Portfolio is defined in Part A.
When used in this Part B it only relates to where your portfolio references a Premium Investments Model Portfolio. ¡ Your Portfolio Assets is defined in Part A.
For Premium Investments Model Portfolios as well as the Portfolio Assets listed in Part A some or all of the Funds are provided and managed by the Model Portfolio Manager or managed by other asset managers employed by the Model Portfolio Manager. ¡ Any references to ‘you’ in this Part B means a customer whose portfolios reference Premium Investments Model Portfolios on the Hub and has not been notified by Santander UK plc that these transitional terms do not apply.
If you act as trustee for another person you are responsible to us to ensure you have the authority of the trust to do so.
Where ‘you’ are a trustee you agree to notify us of any changes in your authority.
If required by us you will obtain the agreement of any person taking over your authority to be bound by these terms.
Altered terms Some of the terms in Schedule 4 Part A the General Terms and Schedules 1 to 3 apply in a different way where Your Portfolios reference Premium Investments Model Portfolios.
Below we have explained which terms apply in a different way.
Paragraphs 3.3 3.4 3.5 and 3.6 of Schedule 4 Part A sets out the roles that SIM and Santander UK plc play in the Model Portfolio Service.
SIM also plays an additional role for you namely facilitating the move of Your Portfolios that reference Premium Investments Model Portfolios onto the Hub.
In addition Santander UK plc also plays an additional role namely providing advice as to the continued suitability of Your Portfolios which includes those that reference Premium Investments Model Portfolios in connection with the move onto the Hub and the associated Model Portfolio Service based on the information you have provided to Santander UK plc.
The General Terms state that you must ensure that you meet the eligibility criteria for this Service at all times and paragraph 4 of Schedule 4 Part A sets out the eligibility criteria that you must meet at all times.
Clause c and f of paragraph 4 require you to meet a minimum investment amount and to hold a minimum operating balance.
During the transitional period these requirements are temporarily waived for you meaning that you can have an investment amount below the minimum operating balance and do not have to meet any minimum investment amounts until we notify you otherwise.
Note that the other eligibility criteria do apply.
In addition paragraph 4.2 of Schedule 4 Part A requires you to notify us if you do not meet the eligibility criteria.
As we have temporarily waived the minimum investment amount and minimum operating balance requirements you do not need to notify us if you do not meet them.
Paragraph 5.1 of Schedule 4 Part A sets out when Your Portfolio will be set up.
As Your Portfolio is already established paragraph 5.1 does not apply to you.
Instead Your Portfolio has been moved onto the Hub.
Paragraph 5.2 of Schedule 4 Part A refers to instructions we may receive from your Adviser concerning which Model Portfolios Your Portfolios should reference and which account type Your Portfolios will be held in.
For clarity when Your Portfolio is moved onto the Hub it will continue to reference the same Premium Investments Model Portfolios and will be held in the same type of accounts unless your Adviser instructs us otherwise.
Taking money out / withdrawals / selling your investments
Paragraphs 8.1 8.2 8.3 and 8.4 of Schedule 4 Part A set out how you can take money out of Your Portfolios.
These apply in a different way for you as set out below
paragraphs 8.1 8.3 and 8.4 say that you can only take money out of Your Portfolios by contacting your Adviser.
For you you can also take money out of Your Portfolios without needing to contact an Adviser by contacting us directly.
You can give us SIM instructions to take money out of Your Portfolios by any of the following methods ¡ other than for Special Access Accounts by telephone and providing us with selected security details or ¡ in person by prior arrangement or through your Adviser or ¡ through a written instruction e.g. letter signed by you.
We receive handle and process your instructions in accordance with paragraph 9 of Schedule 2 and paragraph 8 of Schedule 4 Part A.
paragraph 8.2 of Schedule 4 Part A says that when taking money out you must maintain the minimum operating balance.
As per paragraph b above until such time as you are notified that the transitional period has ended or that these terms no longer apply to you the requirement to maintain a minimum operating balance is waived.
For the avoidance of doubt during the transitional period and where you are taking a partial withdrawal you still cannot take money out where this would result in more than 85% of Your Portfolio’s value being taken.
paragraphs 8.3 and 8.4 of Schedule 4 Part A state that we will take instructions from your Adviser in connection with taking money out.
You are able to take money out without contacting an Adviser and so paragraphs 8.3 and 8.4 should be read so that we can take instructions from your Adviser or from you.
Paragraph 11.1 of Schedule 4 Part A sets out that the details of the initial Advisory Service Fee will be provided to you separately as part of the advice process.
For clarity you will not be charged an initial Advisory Service Fee as a result of moving Your Portfolios that reference Premium Investments Model Portfolios onto the Hub.
However as set out in paragraph 7.2 of Schedule 4 Part A you may be charged an Advisory Service Fee where you receive advice on any further investment into Your Portfolios.
In addition you will also be charged the Ongoing Adviser Services Fee.
Paragraph 11.4 of Schedule 4 Part A sets out that the indicative value for the Ongoing Adviser Services Fee is set out in separate documentation provided by Santander UK plc and confirmed in the Summary of Costs and Charges section in a Suitability Report provided to you by your Adviser.
As Your Portfolios already reference Premium Investments Model Portfolios which have been moved onto the Hub as part of the Model Portfolio Service this won’t apply to you.
Instead the indicative value including any minimum or maximums for the Ongoing Adviser Services Fee is set out in the Summary of Costs and Charges that was sent to you.
Changing the reference Model Portfolio monitoring Your Portfolio and Rebalancing
Paragraph 13.4 of Schedule 4 Part A sets out what factors your Adviser will consider when providing their initial advice to you on whether the Model Portfolio Service is suitable for you.
As Your Portfolios already reference Premium Investments Model Portfolios and you receive the Model Portfolio Service you will have already received this initial advice.
Your Adviser will consider these factors when providing the ongoing adviser services to you.
Paragraph 17.5 of Schedule 4 Part A and paragraph 16.2b of the General Terms sets out that we may close Your Portfolio / end the Service / close your Hub Account where you no longer meet the eligibility criteria or Your Portfolio falls below the minimum operating balance for the Service.
As set out in paragraph b of this Part B above we have temporarily waived certain elements of the eligibility criteria and the minimum operating balance requirements and so during the transitional period we will not be entitled to close Your Portfolio / end the Service for these reasons.
Paragraph 26 of Schedule 4 Part A sets out what we are not liable to you for.
In addition for you we are also not liable to you in relation to any decision made by you to take money out of Your Portfolios without advice as set out above under the heading ‘Taking money out / withdrawals / selling your investments’.
Paragraph 3.2 of the General Terms states that your ISA will begin as soon as we accept your completed Application and receive your valid payment.
If you don’t already have a Stocks and Shares ISA you can only open one for the purposes of holdings some or all of Your Portfolios in the Model Portfolio Service after consultation with your Adviser
Part 1 - Personal Loans Terms & Conditions These Terms and Conditions will form part of your Agreement with us should you apply for and be accepted for a Personal Loan with us.
Transfer of loan funds Your loan funds will be paid directly to your existing credit card account shown in your credit agreement.
How do we calculate interest
Your interest rate is fixed and won’t change during the loan term.
We’ll work out interest each day on the outstanding loan amount.
This means you’ll pay more interest towards the start of the loan when the outstanding loan amount is at its highest.
As the loan amount reduces you’ll pay less in interest and more towards the amount you’ve borrowed.
The amount you need to pay each month won’t change even if the amount you’re paying in interest goes up or down.
However if you miss a monthly repayment the duration of the loan will be longer to allow us to collect the missed payment.
This means you’ll end up paying more interest overall because it’ll take you longer to repay the full amount so you’ll be paying interest for a longer period of time.
Remember you’ll also end up paying interest on top of interest for payments you miss.
We will add interest to your loan on the last day of each month.
Also if you need to pay any taxes as a result of taking out this loan this is your responsibility.
How do you make repayments
We will take repayments by Direct Debit.
You must make your first repayment 30 days after the start of the loan agreement.
After that your repayments will be due on the same date each month but if this is a non-working day we’ll take your repayment on the next working day.
Let’s say the loan agreement starts on 2 March.
We’ll take your first repayment on 2 April by Direct Debit.
Unless you ask us to change that date we’ll take all other repayments on the 2nd of the month until your loan is paid back in full.
Once we pay you the loan amount you can ask us to change your repayment date.
You can choose a date between the 1st and 28th of the month.
Depending on the date it could mean that your last repayment is collected after the original date that your loan agreement was due to end.
You can also ask us at any time to take a break from your monthly repayments.
This is called a ‘repayment holiday’.
If we agree you might be allowed a maximum of six repayment holidays.
Bear in mind even though you won’t need to make repayments we will keep adding interest to your loan during the holiday.
This means your loan will last longer because you’ll make extra repayments to make up for the ones you missed.
You’ll also pay more interest overall.
What happens if you miss a payment
If you pay us less than you owe or don’t keep to this agreement we can Require you to repay the remaining loan amount back straight away. Use money you have in any other accounts held with us to pay off your outstanding balance. Charge you our reasonable costs in trying to collect the loan amount from you including legal costs and costs finding you.
You will have to pay these costs to us straight away. Sell your loan to a different company who will continue to try and collect the loan from you. Take legal action to recover what you owe us.
This could include asking a court to order that if a property you own is sold for any reason some of the money you get from the sale is used to repay what you owe us. Give information about you and how you’ve managed your account to licensed credit reference agencies.
This will affect your credit rating and might make it more difficult for you to borrow in future.
We’ll usually let you know before we do any of these things.
If you would like more information about managing your finances please speak to us in a branch or give us a call on 0800 876 6386.
You can also find more information online in the help and support area of our website at Santander.co.uk/ personal/support/help-with-managing-my-money. 6
When can we change this agreement
We might change the terms of this agreement in some circumstances but we’ll let you know beforehand.
We’ll only change this agreement if we need to make the change to comply with a legal or regulatory requirement or we reasonably think that making the change would be in your best interests.
We’ll never increase the interest rate or the amount of your monthly repayment.
When can we end this agreement
We can demand that you repay the entire balance of the loan and end this agreement if We suspect a fraud scam or any other illegal activity in relation to this agreement or another agreement you hold with us We are acting in response to guidance issued by a regulator government or law enforcement body The agreement with you may cause us or another member of our group to face regulatory censure or censure by government law enforcement or a third party in any jurisdiction The agreement with you may cause us to break any law regulation court order code or other duty that applies to us We think you are using the loan to buy cryptocurrency We think you’ve given us false or misleading information A court declares you bankrupt You break this agreement regularly or seriously for example by not providing us with information we’ve reasonably asked for on more than one occasion.

When you contact us ask for an early settlement statement and we’ll send you a statement which tells you how much you need to pay.
By law we have to use a specific formula to work out the amount you need to pay.
Repaying your entire loan early - We’ll calculate the amount of interest you need to pay us assuming that you repay your loan 28 days after you contact us.
If your loan is more than 12 months long we might also charge an extra 30 days of interest.
Repaying part of your loan early - If you want to pay some of your loan early you can choose to either Shorten the duration of the loan but keep your monthly payments the same Keep the loan duration the same but reduce your monthly payments.
