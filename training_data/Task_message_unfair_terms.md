# I need you to come up with strings of text that could appear in terms and conditions contracts for consumer financial products (concerning bank accounts, savings, credit, loans, investments etc.). **The purpose of the training data that I need you to generate is to identify unfair/concerning terms in these contracts. I need you to generate a wide variety of potential contract text.**

## Requirments

- **Create a mix of simple and convoluted/complex sentences.**
- **Generate text that would appear in a contact between a financial institution (such as a bank) and a consumer.**

- The strings should be between 5-40 words in length
	- The majority of strings should be longer than the average
- Be creative: Come up with text from different scenarios
- Each string should be on a new line

- **!The strings should not include any symbols!**

### IMPORTANT: Put the number 1 as the first character of every sentences without any white spaces!

### IMPORTANT: I would like sentences that vary in length from 5 to 40 words. Please ensure that the sentence lengths are as diverse as possible, not merely averaging around the middle of this range. 
### Include some shorter sentences close to the 5-word minimum and some longer ones approaching the 40-word maximum, along with various lengths in between to achieve a broad spectrum of sentence sizes.

# Generate strings without without any numbering or list formatting and nothing else.
