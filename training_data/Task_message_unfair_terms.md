# I need you to generate textual snippets that could appear in terms and conditions contracts for consumer financial products (bank accounts, savings, credit, loans, investments etc.). The purpose is to identify unfair/concerning terms. I require a diverse array of text snippets in terms of length and complexity.

## Requirements

- **Generate a mix of linguistic constructs including single clauses, phrases, standalone sentences, and composite sentences.**
- **Text should vary significantly in length from very short (5 words) to the maximum allowed (40 words).**
- **Be creative: Text should simulate different contractual scenarios between a financial institution and a consumer.**

- Each snippet should be on a new line.

- **!Avoid using any symbols in the text!**

## IMPORTANT: Begin every snippet with the number 1 immediately followed by the text, without any space in between. 

### Generate text without any numbering, list formatting, or additional marks.
