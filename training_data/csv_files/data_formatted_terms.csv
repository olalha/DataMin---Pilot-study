This means there may be a delay between using your card to make a payment and the transaction appearing on your account.

Interest is charged on Purchases Advances Money Transfers and Balance Transfers from the date the transaction is applied to the account until paid.
Interest accrues on fees and charges except annual or Instalment Plan fees.
This interest accrues at the Purchases rate and is charged from the date of application to the account until paid.
Default Charge interest will not be charged before expiry of any deferral period required by law.
Interest on interest accrues at the same rate as the category of transaction fee or charge on which interest is charged from the date that interest is applied.
We do not charge interest on interest for Default Charges.
Interest is calculated using a daily interest rate derived from the Annual Rate on the average daily balance since the previous statement date.
Your statement will show a balance and a payment date.
If you pay the full balance and also paid the full balance on the previous month’s statement by the relevant payment dates you will not have to pay interest on Purchases.
Interest is applied to your account on the statement date but when necessary an adjustment to include interest on Purchases will be made on the next statement.
Interest will continue to be charged after any court order for payment until it is satisfied. 9 6 Payments
Payments to your account will not reduce a balance until the payment is cleared.
Your monthly statement includes information about clearance periods.
You cannot choose how a payment is applied to your account.
We apply any payments you make to your account in the following order
to pay your contractual Minimum Payment under section 2 of this Agreement
to pay any Instalment Plan fees
to pay any monthly Instalment Plan repayments if you have more than one plan we’ll first pay off the one which ends soonest
to reduce sums shown on your most recent monthly statement excluding Instalment Plans according to their interest rates with the highest rate paid first
to reduce the remainder of the outstanding balances on any Instalment Plans on the account and
finally if any payment exceeds your most recent monthly statement balance the excess will then be applied to reduce sums charged to your account but not yet shown on any monthly statement.
This is also done according to their interest rates with the highest interest rate paid first.
If parts of any of the balances referred to in b have the same
interest rate sums on which interest is charged on interest will reduce first
special offer interest rate they will be reduced according to their special offer expiry dates with the earlier paid first.
We treat any payments made to your account as reducing overdue amounts from previous monthly statements before reducing the Minimum Payment.
We may give notice allowing you not to make a Minimum Payment.
If so interest will still accrue.
If a payment is made to your account and the payer’s bank tells us that it is a mistake we may pass them your contact details so that they can discuss the payment with you.
This will happen if you tell us that the payment has been made correctly or do not respond when we ask you about it. 7 Lost or stolen cards

What is an Instalment Plan
It’s an option we might offer on your account to let you pay larger Purchases off in fixed monthly instalments.
We might also offer this option on Balance Transfers that are or are shortly to be out of their promotional period.
If it’s available to you we’ll let you know via our mobile banking app once you’ve made a qualifying transaction or have an eligible Balance Transfer.
We’ll tell you more about any available plan including fees via the app before you take it out.
How does it work
If we tell you you’re eligible to move a transaction or eligible Balance Transfer to an Instalment Plan you’ll have a set amount of time to tell us you want to do this.
We’ll then move the transaction or Balance Transfer amount to a plan and you’ll pay a monthly fee and a fixed instalment on top of your normal monthly Minimum Payment.
We don’t charge any interest on Instalment Plan repayments or Instalment Plan fees.
Missing an Instalment Plan repayment If you miss or only partly pay one Instalment Plan repayment the amount of that repayment or in the case of a partial payment the shortfall will go back into the main part of your credit card balance from your next monthly statement date and interest will be charged at your normal Purchases or Balance Transfers rate as applicable.
Due to how we apply payments if you only partly pay one Instalment Plan repayment then the Instalment Plan fee or a proportion of it may also go back into your main balance.
You will see any missed or partly made Instalment Plan repayments in the app.
We will not charge interest on the Instalment Plan fee.
If you miss or partly pay two Instalment Plan repayments the full Instalment Plan balance will go back into the main part of your credit card balance from your next monthly statement date and interest will be charged at your normal Purchases or Balance Transfers rate as applicable.
We will not charge interest on the Instalment Plan fee.
Cancelling an Instalment Plan An Instalment Plan will end if you miss or partly pay two Instalment Plan repayments as outlined above at point c.
You can cancel an Instalment Plan at any time.
If you do you will not be charged any additional monthly Instalment Plan fees and the Instalment Plan balance will go back into the main part of your credit card balance on the next working day.
Interest will be charged at your normal Purchases or Balance Transfers rate as applicable.
We will not charge interest on the Instalment Plan fee.
We can cancel an Instalment Plan if you break your Agreement with us.
